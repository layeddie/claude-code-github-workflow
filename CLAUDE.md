# CLAUDE.md - GitHub Workflow Blueprint Project

**Project**: Claude Code GitHub Workflow Automation Blueprint
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: 2025-11-06
**Status**: Phase 1 - Core Foundation ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository provides a **production-ready blueprint** for automating GitHub workflows from planning to deployment using **Claude Code** and **GitHub Actions**. The blueprint is designed for developers of all skill levels (beginners to professionals) and supports flexible branching strategies and project types (web, mobile, fullstack).

---

## 📋 Source of Truth

### **Master Plan & PRD**
**→ `implementation.md`** is the **PRIMARY SOURCE OF TRUTH** for all implementation work.

This file contains:
- ✅ Complete vision, mission, and success metrics
- ✅ Detailed architecture and system design
- ✅ 3-phase implementation plan with tasks and subtasks
- ✅ Acceptance criteria for every component
- ✅ Timeline and milestones
- ✅ Technical specifications

**ALL implementation work MUST follow the specifications in `implementation.md`.**

---

## 📚 Reference Documentation

The following files are **REFERENCE ONLY** and provide context but are NOT the source of truth:

### `gh-workflow-master-instructions.md`
- Original master prompt that guided the initial design
- Contains high-level requirements and architecture concepts
- **NOTE**: Some details (like "max 5 issues") have been superseded by `implementation.md` (now max 10)
- Use for understanding original intent, but defer to `implementation.md` for specifics

### `anthropics-claude-code-gh-actions.md`
- Official Claude Code Action repository documentation
- Contains v1 GA API specifications and authentication methods
- **Use for**: Correct Claude Code Action syntax and capabilities
- Always use v1 GA patterns (not beta)

### `claude-code-github-document.md`
- User-facing documentation for Claude Code GitHub integration
- Contains setup guides and usage examples
- **Use for**: Understanding user perspective and quickstart patterns

### `examples/` Directory
- Example implementations from previous iterations
- **⚠️ WARNING**: Examples may contain outdated patterns or mismatches
- **Use for**: Learning patterns, but ALWAYS validate against `implementation.md` specifications
- Do NOT copy directly without validation

## ✨ Key Design Decisions

### Branching Strategies (Flexible)
The blueprint supports three strategies (user choice):
1. **Simple**: `feature → main` (small teams)
2. **Standard**: `feature → dev → main` (recommended)
3. **Complex**: `feature → dev → staging → main` (enterprise)

### Task Limits
- **Max 10 tasks per plan** (hard limit)
- Includes milestone definition and correct labeling
- Enforced in claude-plan-to-issues.yml workflow

### Claude Code Action Version
- **Use v1 GA only** (not beta)
- Simplified configuration (auto mode detection)
- Reference: anthropics-claude-code-gh-actions.md

### Mobile Support
- **Optional/bonus feature** (not mandatory)
- Path-based filtering (`mobile/`, `android/`, `ios/`)
- Only runs when relevant files changed

### Project Board
- **GitHub Projects v2** (GraphQL API)
- 7-status system: To triage → Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → To Deploy → Done
- Users can customize status names in their projects
- Bidirectional sync with issues

---

## 🔐 Security & Safety

### Built-in Protections
- ✅ **Rate limiting**: Circuit breaker pattern (50+ API calls minimum)
- ✅ **Fork safety**: Read-only operations for fork PRs
- ✅ **Branch protection**: No deletions, squash-only, linear history
- ✅ **Secret scanning**: Prevent committing credentials
- ✅ **Kill switch**: Emergency workflow disable mechanism
- ✅ **Idempotency**: All operations safe to retry
- ✅ **Debouncing**: 10-second delays prevent infinite loops

---

## 📊 Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- All 8 workflows execute successfully
- All 8 slash commands work as documented
- All 4 specialized agents complete their tasks autonomously

## 📝 Working Guidelines

### When Implementing
1. **Always refer to `implementation.md`** for specifications
2. **Use Claude Code Action v1 GA** (not beta patterns)
3. **Follow examples/** patterns for structure, but validate against specs
4. **Test each component** before moving to next
5. **Update this file** with progress

### When in Doubt
1. Check `implementation.md` first (source of truth)
2. Reference official docs (anthropics-claude-code-gh-actions.md)
3. Look at examples for patterns (but validate)
4. Ask for clarification if specs unclear

### Quality Gates
- Lint and format all YAML files
- Validate workflow syntax before committing
- Test workflows with example data
- Document any deviations from plan

## 🎯 Project Goals Reminder

**Vision**: Industry-standard GitHub + Claude Code automation blueprint
**Mission**: Empower developers (beginners to pros) with production-ready workflows
**Values**: Simplicity, reliability, flexibility, excellent DX

---

**Remember**: This is a **blueprint for other developers**, not just a project for ourselves. Every decision should prioritize:
- **Clarity** over cleverness
- **Reliability** over features
- **Documentation** over assumptions
- **Usability** over complexity

Let's build something world-class! 🚀

**REMEBER** Keep this @CLAUDE.md file always Up to date and as a living document. The @implementation.md file must be always updated.
