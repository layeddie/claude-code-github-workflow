## 🎨 Branching Strategies

Choose the strategy that fits your team:

### Simple (Small Teams)
```
feature/* → main
fix/* → main
hotfix/* → main
```

### Standard (Recommended)
```
feature/* → dev → main
fix/* → dev → main
hotfix/* → dev → main
```

### Complex (Enterprise)
```
feature/* → dev → staging → main
fix/* → dev → staging → main
hotfix/* → staging → main (fast-track)
```

The blueprint supports all three strategies out of the box. Choose during setup.

---

## 🔀 Special Branch Patterns

The `Release to Main` workflow allows specific branch patterns to merge directly to `main`:

| Pattern | Purpose | Use Case |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `dev` | Production releases | Standard release flow (dev → main) |
| `test/*` | Workflow validation | Testing CI/CD changes (e.g., test/workflow-validation) |
| `release/*` | Hotfix releases | Emergency fixes bypassing dev (e.g., release/1.0.1) |
| `dependabot/*` | Dependency updates | Automated dependency PRs |

**Example:**
```bash
# Test workflow changes
git checkout -b test/new-ci-feature
git push origin test/new-ci-feature
# PR to main will run all release gates

# Emergency hotfix
git checkout -b release/1.0.1-security-patch
git push origin release/1.0.1-security-patch
# PR to main with fast-track release gates
```

All other branches must follow the standard flow (feature/* → dev → main).

## 🔒 Security & Safety

Built-in protections ensure safe, reliable automation:

- ✅ **Rate Limiting** - Circuit breaker pattern (50+ API calls minimum)
- ✅ **Fork Safety** - Read-only operations for fork PRs
- ✅ **Branch Protection** - No force push, no deletion, squash-only merges
- ✅ **Secret Scanning** - Automatic detection of credentials in commits
- ✅ **Kill Switch** - Emergency workflow disable mechanism
- ✅ **Idempotency** - All operations safe to retry
- ✅ **Debouncing** - 10-second windows prevent infinite loops
- ✅ **Quality Gates** - Automated lint, test, typecheck, security audits
